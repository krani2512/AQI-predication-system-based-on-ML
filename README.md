# AQI-predication-system-based-on-ML

Air pollution has become one of the biggest environmental and public health threats in the 21st century and in many rapidly urbanizing parts of the world. 
Current AQI forecasting methods largely rely on conventional statistical methods and deterministic models, which overlook critical non-linear relationships and time-based dependencies in air quality data. 
The issues associated with current forecasting systems pose significant limitations on predictive accuracy related to short-term forecasting a sudden pollution event, little to no computational efficiency (for real-time purposes), and poor generalization across urban environments.
 As a result, the limitations of the existing prediction systems undermine the overall effectiveness of public health warning systems and the ability to implement timely pollution mitigation.
This research project accommodates these challenges through the development and evaluation of machine learning models capable of consistently and accurately predicting AQI values at multiple time horizons (24- h, 48- h, and 72- h). 
More specifically, the study has two goals: 
               (1) To determine the best combination of input features and preprocessing approaches to use for predicting AQI                                   
               (2) perform a comparison amongst the different machine learning algorithms, including classic machine learning, ensemble, and deep learning methods
